This is a webpage to display data in virtualised form

d3 JavaScript module and some AngularJS is used

To run:
> open index.html using browser(I am using Chrome).  
> choose data.csv file to upload to the webpage as requested.  
> enjoy the data  

This project is still beyond my level of understanding of how JavaScript and AngularJS works so I cherrypicked many source codes from internet. References are given below.  
Data for android samples are taken from: https://bl.ocks.org/chrisrzhou
