5. Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form 
	ax^2+bx+c=0 (a!=0)
Use doubles for user inputs for a, b, c. Output two or one solutions if there're real number roots. Output 'invalid' if there're not. Output 'error' if the format of input is wrong. You should keep two decimal places for the results.
Sample: 
input: 
1.2 5.0 1  
output: 
-0.21 -3.96
input: 
1.0 -2 1.0
output:
1.00 
input: 
-2.3 1 hello
output:
error
input: 
-1.3 0.5 -6.9
output: 
invalid

6. Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. The first input number indicates how many integers are in the array. The following integers are the content of the array. 
Sample:
intput:  
5 1 2 2 1 3
output: 
3
input: 
7 5 8 7 8 5 6 7
output: 
6
